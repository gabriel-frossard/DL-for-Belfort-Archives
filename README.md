### Text Image Segmentation and XML Creation Project

This project is focused on segmenting text images into paragraph and text line levels using manual layout analysis and creating corresponding XML files. It includes several Jupyter notebooks, each serving a specific part of the process.

### "controller.ipynb"

Responsible for orchestrating the overall process. It calls functions or methods defined in other notebooks.

### "create_xml_file.ipynb"

Handles the creation of XML files. This notebook probably converts the segmented text image data into an XML format.

### "main.ipynb"

Serves as the main entry point for the project. 

### "preprocessing.ipynb"

Used for preprocessing tasks. This could include image normalization, denoising, or other preprocessing steps necessary before segmentation.

### "read_txt_file.ipynb"

Manages reading text files (transcription). 

### Usage

To use this project, run the "main.ipynb" notebook. Ensure that all other notebooks, transcription files, and the dataset are in the same directory since they are likely called by the notebooks.
